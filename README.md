# workshop-resources

This repository is for content developed as part of the RAPID Water Workshop held May-June 2021.

The workshop featured participants from Puerto Rico and North Carolina who work in areas related to water resources.


The goal is for workshop participants to add to the items in order to 1) practice using Github, and 2) to create a set of community-curated resources.
